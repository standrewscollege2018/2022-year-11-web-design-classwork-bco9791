        <h2 class="topHeading">United Kingdom</h2>
        <p class="headingp">We spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as we could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights! <br>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>

        <h2>Greece</h2>
        <p class="headingp">Greece was a stunning surprise. We stayed in Crete for a week and were seduced by the scenery, history and the sheer friendliness of the locals. </p>
        <p class="headingp">We also spent time in Athens, marvelling at many of the ancient ruins.</p>

        <h2>France</h2>
        <p class="headingp">We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.</p>
        <p class="headingp">Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights.</p>
        <p class="headingp">We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.</p>
